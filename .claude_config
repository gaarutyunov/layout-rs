# Claude AI Assistant Configuration for layout-rs

## Project Overview
This is a Rust-based keyboard layout editor using Yew framework and Trunk for building/serving WASM applications.

## Important Instructions

### Terminal Management
- **ALWAYS** check for active terminals before running `trunk serve` or `cargo build` commands
- Use `get_terminal_output` tool to check if the application is already running
- Look for output containing "Local:" or "trunk serve" to identify if dev server is active
- If dev server is already running, inform the user instead of starting a new one
- Default dev server runs on port 8080

### Development Commands
- Build: `cargo check` (for quick compilation check)
- Serve: `trunk serve --port 8080` (only if not already running)
- The application uses WASM and requires trunk for serving

### File Structure
- Main source: `src/` directory
- Components: `src/components/` 
- Styles: `index.scss`
- Entry point: `index.html`

### Key Features
- Keyboard layout editor for Dactyl Manuform 5x7
- Key library with custom key management
- Local storage persistence
- Reset and factory reset functionality

### Best Practices
1. Always check active terminals first
2. Use cargo check for quick validation
3. Only start new servers when necessary
4. Prefer targeted file edits over large rewrites
