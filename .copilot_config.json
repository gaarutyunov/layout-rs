    "This is a Rust keyboard layout editor project using Yew and Trunk.",
    "IMPORTANT: Always check active terminals before running serve/build commands.",
    "Use get_terminal_output tool to check if trunk serve is already running on port 8080.",
    "Look for 'Local:' or 'trunk serve' in terminal output to identify active dev server.",
    "If dev server is running, inform user instead of starting new instance.",
    "Prefer 'cargo check' for quick compilation validation.",
    "Only run 'trunk serve --port 8080' if no dev server is detected.",
    "Main components are in src/components/ directory.",
    "Styling is in index.scss file.",
    "Project features keyboard layout editing with local storage persistence."
