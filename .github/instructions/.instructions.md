# Copilot Instructions for Layout-RS

This is a Rust keyboard layout editor project using Yew and Trunk.

## Project Structure
- Main components are in `src/components/` directory
- Styling is in `index.scss` file
- Project features keyboard layout editing with local storage persistence

## Development Workflow
- Always check active terminals before running serve/build commands
- Use `get_terminal_output` tool to check if trunk serve is already running on port 8080
- Look for 'Local:' or 'trunk serve' in terminal output to identify active dev server
- If dev server is running, inform user instead of starting new instance
- Prefer `cargo check` for quick compilation validation
- Only run `trunk serve --port 8080` if no dev server is detected

## Build Tools and Commands
- **Framework**: Yew (Rust WebAssembly frontend framework)
- **Build Tool**: Trunk
- **Dev Server**: `trunk serve --port 8080`
- **Quick Check**: `cargo check`
- **Build**: `trunk build`

## Best Practices
- Check for running processes before starting new development servers using `check_server.sh`
- Use cargo check for fast compilation feedback
- Maintain component modularity in the components directory
- Follow Rust and Yew conventions for component structure
