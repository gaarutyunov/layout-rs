## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you don't already have it installed, it's time to install Rust: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.
The rest of this guide assumes a typical Rust installation which contains both `rustup` and Cargo.

To compile Rust to WASM, we need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.
If you don't already have it, install it with the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Install [Trunk], the build tool for Rust-generated WebAssembly:

```bash
cargo install --locked trunk
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
trunk serve
```

This will build the app, start a local server, and automatically rebuild when you make changes.

### Production Build

Build the app for production:

```bash
trunk build --release
```

The optimized build will be available in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment workflow:

1. **Triggers**: Runs on every push to the `main` branch
2. **Build Process**: 
   - Installs Rust with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
   - Installs Trunk build tool
   - Builds the project with `trunk build --release`
   - Caches dependencies for faster builds
3. **Deploy**: Automatically deploys the built application to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually to GitHub Pages:

1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
2. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to the `main` branch or manually trigger the workflow

The live application will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/layout-rs/`

## Usage

1. **Select a Key**: Click on any key in the keyboard layout to select it
2. **Edit Key Mapping**: Use the key editor to modify the selected key's function
3. **Switch Layers**: Use the layer controls to navigate between different keyboard layers
4. **Save Changes**: Click the save button to persist your layout changes
5. **Load Layouts**: Load previously saved layouts or start fresh

## Key Library

The Key Library provides a comprehensive collection of predefined keys organized into categories, making it easy to assign functions to your keyboard keys. It also supports custom keys for specialized use cases.

### Predefined Categories

- **Letters**: A-Z alphabet keys
- **Numbers**: Numeric keys 0-9
- **Function Keys**: F1-F12 function keys
- **Modifiers**: SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, GUI, CMD, WIN, META, SUPER (including left/right variants)
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys, HOME, END, PAGE UP/DOWN, INSERT, DELETE, BACKSPACE, TAB, ESC
- **Symbols**: Common symbols and punctuation marks
- **Special**: CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, media controls, system keys
- **Numpad**: Numeric keypad keys including operators
- **Layers**: Layer switching keys (LAYER0-5, LOWER, RAISE, ADJUST, etc.)
- **Macros**: Predefined macro keys and common shortcuts (COPY, PASTE, CUT, UNDO, REDO, etc.)
- **Mouse**: Mouse button and movement keys
- **Empty**: Special "no operation" keys (NONE, TRANS, ___, XXX, NO)

### Custom Keys

You can add your own custom keys to the library:

1. **Add Custom Keys**: Click the "+" button in the Key Library header
2. **Specify Category**: Optionally provide a custom category name (defaults to "Custom")
3. **Enter Key Name**: Type the name for your custom key (automatically converted to uppercase)
4. **Manage Custom Keys**: Remove custom keys using the "Ã—" button next to each custom key

Custom keys are automatically saved to your browser's local storage and persist between sessions.

### Using the Key Library

- **Browse Categories**: Scroll through the organized categories to find the key you need
- **Quick Selection**: Click any key in the library to assign it to the currently selected keyboard key
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover over keys to see tooltips with additional information

## Architecture

This project is built with:

- **[Yew](https://yew.rs/)**: A modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps
- **[Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)**: A WASM web application bundler for Rust
- **WebAssembly**: For high-performance web applications
- **Web APIs**: Local storage for persistence, modern CSS for styling
